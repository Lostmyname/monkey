You're on the 3.0 version of this branch, which is the version used in eagle.

Monkey is the new version of the widget which won't use an iframe.

Use context.html for development and tests.html for testing. index.html doesn't
do much.

## Installation

Run `npm install` and then `gulp` to generate the CSS and start browser-sync.
